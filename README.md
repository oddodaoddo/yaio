YAIO is yet another internet footprint obfuscator.

It will take a list of websites and basically visit them randomly for as long as it is running.

Down the road it will also be able to login into your "alternate" social media accounts, keep cookies etc. etc.

Thus, we create an alternate "personality" online, that is visiting all sorts of sites - Christian, Muslim, Buddhist etc., Fox News, CNN, MSNBC, sites about cars, trucks, various hobbies, shopping etc., thus "confusing" whoever is trying to build a "profile" of you.

If many people ran the same thing like YAIO - how would they know who is who?
